# BlinkIt

With the world of IT being expanded every millisecond, we present to you a caring tool, which looks cool as well as compliments the fashion. It detects the number of blinks per second and notifies you when your blinks per minute reduces below an average value. How is it helpful? People working on computer/laptops/tablets/mobile phones generally sit in front of these gadgets for quite a long hours. Prolonged exposure to them may make their eyes prone to dryness to a great extent.<br/>
Working in the night has become an evolutionary trend. If your eyes get exposed to high brightness, we prevent that by putting shades in front your glasses. If you want to go outdoors wearing these cool glasses, it will guard you from high intensity sunlight thereby protecting you from high intensity UV Rays. Also, the distance between the screen and eyes must be at least 20 inches(51 cm). If you bring screen nearer, product will notify you. It will also notify you to take a break of 20 seconds after 20 minutes. The product is a complete eye care - wear. </br>

The 20-20-20 rule is based on this research paper - https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234014282.pdf . Which shows the importance of this rule when we have a prolonged exposure to nearpoint visual strain that is due to the extensive use of pc's and laptop's. </br>

### What we tried to solve
1. Give reminder to user when their blink rate is less. </br>
2. Implemented an alarm which will also notify you to take a break of 20 seconds after 20 minutes.</br>
3. Notify you when you are sitting close to your laptop/pc.</br>
4. A cool sun glass feature which will enable these glasses to automatically convert to a sunglasses when you are in exposure of sunlight. </br>
